    "## Neuroevolution with \"Island Transpeciation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroevolution [21] is an algorithmic method that utilizes *Evolutionary Algorithms* *(EA)* [18] to generate Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [22] parameters, topologies [5, 6, 10, 11, 12] and rules (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution ). In order to find an optimal deep learning model for the time-series forecasting [8, 9] task, architecture search is performed in conjunction with hyper-parameter tuning [23, 34]. Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciation ). With *island speciation*, neuroevolution can be parallelized: Each island [24, 33] can be a distinct thread, process or even a different computing node. Even though the evolution progresses distinctly in each island, populations of meta-learning agents migrate periodically between islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every island can have the same global optimization technique (with similar or different settings versus the other islands), a **species**. A global optimizer like Differential Evolution (DE) [17] (see: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.differential_evolution.html ), maintains a number of different agents internally, that are used in a parameter search. An agent has a different internal representation (*genotype*) depending on the meta-heuristic algorithm. The actual bounded parameter set, the *phenotype*, is a candidate Deep Neural Network (DNN) [6] model architecture that we try to optimize. Within the DE implementation, there exist 2-way operations that can perform genotype-to-phenotype representation conversions and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of global optimization EA islands were used:\n",
    "- **Random (Rand)** [19] island. Creates a random model, by sampling the bounded hyper-parameter values from a uniform pseudo-random number generator. In this case genotype = phenotype and the island population is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Differential Evolution** island. Genotype: energy (real values in [0,1]). Phenotype: the genotype values, scaled from [0, 1] into the bounds of each parameter.\n",
    "![Alt Text](pics/Ackley.gif)\n",
    "*Figure: Example of Differential Evolution optimizing the 2D Ackley function using a population of size 20 (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution#/media/File:Ackley.gif ).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** [16] island (see: https://pythonhosted.org/pyswarm/ ). Genotype: position (multi-dimensional representation of the parameters as real values) and velocity (rate of change of the positions).\n",
    "![Alt Text](pics/ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif)\n",
    "*Figure: A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization#/media/File:ParticleSwarmArrowsAnimation.gif ).*\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it is possible to convert an agent from one global optimization method to another. For example, to convert a DE to a PSO agent: the agent of the DE \"species\" is converted from the DE genotype to the common phenotype (by unscaling real values) and then is converted to the PSO genotype (real values = position & velocity). We define this conversion process as **island transpeciation** (see: http://www.websters1913.com/words/Transpeciate ). Loosely termed, transpeciation acts as a (lossy in some cases) *transformation function* between the agent genotypes of different global optimization functions. Transpeciation in conjunction with the island model, allow combination (via *migration*) and diversification (via unique evolution per island) of different model architecture search methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worth noting is that in order to keep the populations stable on all islands, the migrating agents replace a random agent at the receiving island. In practice, it was a matter of replacing an agent entry on the internal data structures of the EA algorithms. For the local experiments, the island population was fixed to 5 agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, there will be attempts to integrate additional meta-learning islands such as:\n",
    "- Genetic Algorithm (GA) [13, 14, 15].\n",
    "- (Multi-agent) Reinforcement Learning (RL) [4].\n",
    "- Basin Hopping (BH) [20].\n",

The master decides when and to which island to migrate an agent. **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** (see: https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/ ) handles the communication between the islands and the master (see: https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#point-to-point-communication ).\n",

    "All the models except the last, use 10 years of data (station BETN0073): 2000-2009 for training and 2010 for testing. The LSTM models use 51 weather variables, gathered from the surface-level ERA-interim ECMWF database (see: https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/levtype=sfc/ ). We can see that the *Naive LSTM NARX-1* model, with a lag of 1 day has slightly lower MSE and better Index of Agreement (IoA) versus the Fixed-Size Least Squares Support Vector Machine (*FS-LSSVM*). The downside was the longer training time (~5 minutes) compared to the kernel-based approach, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was ~5.38% higher, signigicantly worse. Training time was even more substantial for the **Deep LSTM NARX-1** (~18 minutes, using the full island speciation process), but we can see that it achieves the best performance for the 10-year dataset: MAPE below 25%, IoA at 95% and MSE significantly  lower than the other methods.\n",

Unfortunately, there was no direct mention on the related section about the exogenous variables used and no MAE or SMAPE measurements. For the LSTM methods, all the 51 valid weather time-series were utilized.*"

This potentially shows that the architecture search-space is rather small: currently only deep neural networks with 3x LSTM and 1x Dense cells are allowed in the genotype. Both DE and PSO had 5 agents and used the default parameters. DE has enabled the \"Latin hypercube\" instead of the \"random\" option for the initial agent genotypes. The only non-default option for DE was the mutation strategy: dispatching was done via \"best2exp\" (exponential) versus the default \"best1bin\" (binomial). In addition, for future experiments, more iterations (300+) will be allowed."
